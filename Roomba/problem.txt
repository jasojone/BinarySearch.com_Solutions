A Roomba robot is currently sitting in a Cartesian plane at (0, 0). You are given a list of its moves that it will make, containing NORTH, SOUTH, WEST, and EAST.

Return whether after its moves it will end up in the coordinate (x, y).

Constraints

n â‰¤ 100,000 where n is length of moves
Example 1
Input
moves = ["NORTH", "EAST"]
x = 1
y = 1
Output
true
Explanation
Moving north moves it to (0, 1) and moving east moves it to (1, 1)

Example 2
Input
moves = ["WEST", "EAST"]
x = 1
y = 0
Output
false
Explanation
This Roomba will end up at (0, 0)
